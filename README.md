# PythonistaSceneGestures
An implementation of Gesture recognition in Pythonista Scenes.

This is written entirely in my (limited) free time, and therefore hasn't gotten very far.  I am looking for assitance on making this bit of code better.  

The intention is to provide a class which can be used to attach to a Pythonista "scene" and based on the touches, recognize and act on gestures in the scene.
